# Implementation of Feng's Adaptive RED algorithm in ns-3
##Course Code: CS822
##Assignment: #GP3

###Overview

Feng's Adaptive RED [1] is a variant of Random Early Detection (RED) [2], it makes RED parameters adaptive to handle wide variety of traffic. This repository provides an implementation of SCRED in ns-3.25 [3].

###Simulating SCRED 

To simulate SCRED algorithm, the attribute FengAdaptive must be set to true, as shown below:

`Config::SetDefault ("ns3::RedQueueDisc::FengAdaptive", BooleanValue (true));`
